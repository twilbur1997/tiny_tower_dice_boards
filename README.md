# Intro

Hi there! Thank you for being interested in this project! 

The following write-up contains the following:
1. Screenshots of in-game dice boards
2. Tables describing the resources on those boards
3. The results of millions of artificial dice rolls predicting how many resources are expected per 100 rolls
4. A discussion on the best boards depending on your desired resource and strategy when playing the game

Whether you are a long-standing player of the game, or someone who is just starting out, I hope this data is helpful!

Note that if you are a starting player, I'd recommend reviewing the Tiny Tower Wiki ([here](https://tinytower.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny_Tower_Wiki)) and joining the Tiny Tower community Discord ([here](https://discord.com/invite/BmaZ2aY))!

There's also a Reddit community ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinytower/)). 

<br>

Happy building,

## Fun Disclaimer

This analysis was performed to help users understand the expected values of specific dice boards.

However you wish to play the game to have fun is up to you. You don't have to optimize the fun out of it!

# Board Images

The following boards are organized (A, B, C, Event (if applicable))

****Note that Coins are not standardized between screenshots.***

To standardize Coins, the tables below list Coin rewards as a percentage of the cost of a new floor.

# Board Tables

The following tables describe the tables 

Please note the following:
1. Tokens are listed as a description of their icon 
    - Bronze Key = Regular Token
2. Coins are listed as a percentage of how much it costs to build a floor
    - If a new floor in your tower costs 10,000 coins, a "10% Coins" will give 1,000 coins
3. The "???" tile is also referred to as "Special" in some places since the code wouldn't let me use "???" in some variable names. 
4. There may be errors in the following table!! Let me know in the Tiny Tower Discord @ToadTruck

# Results


## Full Tables

These results reflect 1,000 trials of rolling a dice 1,000 times on each board. Then, the results are normalized to be an expected 100 rolls.

I may publish some more precise tables, or some less precise tables with prettier/rounder numbers in the future.

## Notes

The ??? values are set to zero in the code right now to keep track that they've "been counted". This can be changed if desired, but I believe most boards will have similar values for this tile anyway.

<br>


## Discussion

Overall, Gold Keys are very rare, Golden Tickets are very rare, and Tier 4 Chests are very rare. Golden Dice are also rarer than I expected.

The Premium Board A seems to be the worst Premium board, only leading for Golden Tickets, Tier 2 Chest, and Coins. 

<br>

### Free Board Discussion

1. Coins are pretty even across the boards, with about 400% (or 4 new floors) being earned every 100 rolls
2. There are certain resources which are rare on the free board:
    - Tier 2 Chest (only on event board as of this writing)
    - Tier 3 Chest (only on the Free Board C)
    - Tier 4 Chest (not able to be earned)
    - Gold Key (only on the Free Board C)
    - Golden Ticket and Legendary Ticket


### Premium Board Discussion

Bronze Keys, Silver Keys, and Legendary Tickets were more common than I was expecting.

# Finale

## Best Board per resource?

With all of that discussion - which board is best? Or at least, which board is best for which resource?

## Free Board Finale

For this table, the Event board is NOT considered!! You can review the tables above to check whether the event board is better for particular rewards.

| Resource | Best Boards(s) | Avg per 100 rolls | Worst Board(s) | Avg per 100 rolls | 
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Coins | A or B | 424 | C | 390 | 
| Bux | C | 12,600 | B  | 7,300 | 
| Ad Chest | C | 8.4 |  A or B | 6.7 | 
| Tier 1 Chest | B or C | 14.5 or 15.3 | A | 8.0 | 
| Tier 2 Chest | N/A | 0 | A/B/C | 0 | 
| Tier 3 Chest | C | 1.42 | A or B  | 0 | 
| Tier 4 Chest | N/A | 0 | N/A  | 0 | 
| Bronze Key | C | 24 | B | 8.4 | 
| Silver Key | C | 6.8 | B | 0 | 
| Gold Key | C | 4.2 | A or B  | 0 | 
| Golden Dice | B | 12.7 | A | 0 | 
| Golden Ticket | A or B | 1.25 | C | 0.56 | 
| Legendary Ticket | B | 6.44 | A or C | 0 | 


## Premium Board Finale

Again, for this table, the Event board is NOT considered!! You can review the tables above to check whether the event board is better for particular rewards.


| Resource | Best Boards(s) | Avg per 100 rolls | Worst Board(s) | Avg per 100 rolls | 
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Coins | A | 1900 | C | 780 | 
| Bux | C | 9000 |  A | 4800 | 
| Ad Chest | N/A | 0 | A/B/C | 0 | 
| Tier 1 Chest | B | 15.4 | A or C | 0 | 
| Tier 2 Chest | A | 13.9 | B  | 0 | 
| Tier 3 Chest | A or B | 3.2 | C | 0 | 
| Tier 4 Chest | A | 0.95 | B | 0 |

| Golden Ticket | A | 5.7 | B | 0 | 
| Legendary Ticket | C | 150 | B | 75 |

# Encore

Ok, one more discussion. I've considered some potential users and what they want from a board, and which boards they should roll with.

This is a work in progress, so any feedback is incredibly appreciated!!

1. Coin Collector
    - Looking to accelerate rebuilds or just build the biggest tower using Coins
    - Board A is your best bet - both for regular dice rolls and premium dice rolls
2. Bux Bounty Hunter
    - Aims to acquire as much of that green stuff as possible, either for a leg up when skipping timers or to build a nest egg to spend on the next seasonal event
    - Board C is the board for you. 
        * On the Free Board C, you'll find about 20%-25% more Bux than on A (and 70% more than B). 
        * On the Premium Board C, you'll get almost twice the Bux, and plenty of Silver Keys and Legendary Tickets to boot. 
        * Though, you won't see as many Chests or Coins
3. Legendary Bits Enthusiast
    - Wants to unlock all of the Legendary Bits
    - This one's a bit tough... the Free Board C offers some immediate payoff with higher rates of Ad Chests, Tier 1 Chests, and Tier 3 Chests. Plus, higher rates of Bronze, Silver, and Gold Keys. 
    - But, the Free Board C has less than half the rate of Golden Dice as A or B, making it difficult to earn rolls on the Premium Boards.
    - That said, the Premium Board C has a nice amount of Silver Keys and Legendary Tickets, so once you've earned those Golden Dice, spending them on the Premium Board C would be a good move.
    - Final Verdict:
        * Free A or B for Golden Dice
        * Premium C for Silver Keys and Legendary Tickets
