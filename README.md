# Intro

Hi there! Thank you for being interested in this project! 

## Disclaimer

This page is meant to educate the Tiny Tower community on expected values. However you wish to play the game to have fun is up to you. You don't have to optimize the fun out of it!

# Board Images

The following boards are organized (A, B, C, Event (if applicable))

Note that Coins are not standardized between screenshots, and Coin rewards are directly related to how many floors are in the current tower.

To standardize Coins, the tables below list Coin rewards as a percentage of the cost of a new floor.

# Board Tables

The following tables describe the tables 

Please note the following:
1. Tokens are listed as a description of their icon 
    - Bronze Key = Regular Token
2. Coins are listed as a percentage of how much it costs to build a floor
    - If a new floor in your tower costs 10,000 coins, a "10% Coins" will give 1,000 coins
3. The "???" tile is also referred to as "Mystery" in some places since the code wouldn't let me use "???" in some variable names. 
4. There may be errors in the following table!! Let me know in the Tiny Tower Discord @ToadTruck

# Results


## Full Tables

These results reflect 1,000 trials of rolling a dice 1,000 times on each board. Then, the results are normalized to be an expected 100 rolls.

I may publish some more precise tables, or some less precise tables with prettier/rounder numbers in the future.

## Notes

The ??? values are set to zero in the code right now to keep track that they've "been counted". This can be changed if desired, but I believe most boards will have similar values for this tile anyway.



## Discussion

Overall, Gold Keys are very rare, Golden Tickets are very rare, and Tier 4 Chests are very rare. Golden Dice are also rarer than I expected.

Board A Premium seems to be the worst Premium board, only leading for Golden Tickets, Tier 2 Chest, and Coins. 

### Free Board Discussion

1. Coins are pretty even across the boards, with about 400% (or 4 new floors) being earned every 100 rolls
2. There are certain resources which are rare on the free board:
    - Tier 2 Chest (only on event board as of this writing)
    - Tier 3 Chest (only on Board C free)
    - Tier 4 Chest (not able to be earned)
    - Gold Key (only on Board C free)
    - Golden Ticket and Legendary Ticket


### Premium Board Discussion

Bronze Keys, Silver Keys, and Legendary Tickets were more common than I was expecting.



# Finale: Best Board per resource?

With all of that discussion - which board is best? Or at least, which board is best for which resource?

## Free Board Finale

For this table, the Event board is NOT considered!! You can review the tables above to check whether the event board is better for particular rewards (for Thanksgiving 2025 Free Board, it's very good for Bronze Keys and Silver Keys as well as Legendary Tickets).

## Premium Board Finale

Again, for this table, the Event board is NOT considered!! You can review the tables above to check whether the event board is better for particular rewards (for Thanksgiving 2025 Free Board, it's very good for Bronze Keys and Silver Keys as well as Legendary Tickets).
